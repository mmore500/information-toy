abstract = {Information is a precise concept that can be defined mathematically, but its re-lationship to what we call " knowledge " is not always made clear. Furthermore, the concepts " entropy " and " information " , while deeply related, are distinct and must be used with care, something that is not always achieved in the literature. In this elemen-tary introduction, the concepts of entropy and information are laid out one by one, explained intuitively, but defined rigorously. I argue that a proper understanding of information in terms of prediction is key to a number of disciplines beyond engineering, such as physics and biology.},

abstract = {Information is a key concept in evolutionary biology. Information stored in a biological organism's genome is used to generate the organism and to maintain and control it. Information is also that which evolves. When a population adapts to a local environment, information about this environment is fixed in a representative genome. However, when an environment changes, information can be lost. At the same time, information is processed by animal brains to survive in complex environments, and the capacity for information processing also evolves. Here, I review applications of information theory to the evolution of proteins and to the evolution of information processing in simulated agents that adapt to perform a complex task.},
